# Welcome to the Art Dealer Game!

## Summary: 
This is a project created for the requirements of the SU25-CPSC-60500-001 Software Engineering graduate course. The game involves a student (or student partners) who acts as a seller and submits 4 cards on each turn to the dealer (computer) who then selects a card/art piece to purchase. The art dealer has various patterns in which they make purchases such as all red cards, all queens, prime numbers, basic poker hands, etc. The student's task is to play with the dealer and determine the pattern of pieces they are purchasing. This game can support various grade levels such as K-2, 3-5, and 6-8 with the difficulty increasing for higher grade levels.
